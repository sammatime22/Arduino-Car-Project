Arduino Car Project

About: A while back I had worked on a small RC car using an Arduino Nano, controlled over 
       Bluetooth v2.0. This repo will simply store the parts list, the code, and the circuit 
       schematic (and maybe some other stuff as I can get around to it).

Parts List:
  - 2x Arduino Nanos (1 for Car, 1 for Controller)
  - 2x HC-05 Bluetooth Modules (1 for Car, 1 for Controller)
  - Joystick (for Controller)
  - Basic Wires
  - 2x Brush Motors (for the Car)
  - 2x Wheels, large enough to fit on the Brush Motors
  - 1x guiding wheel, unattached to a motor, used to stabalize the vehicle 
  - 4x NPN, 4x PNP Transistors
  - 2x 1K Ohm, 2x 2K Ohm, 4x (+1 if LED Debugging) 1.2K Ohm Resistors
  - 1x LED (for Controller Debugging)
  - 1x Chasis (for Car)
  - Screws, Bolts, etc.
